# Skin Lesion Analysis with Transfer Learning

## Motivation and Challenges
Skin cancer is a major public health problem, 5M newly diagnosed US each year. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, about 9,000 deaths each year. Early detection of melanoma significantly increases the survival rate. However, accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to:
1. Low contrast between lesions and skin
2. Visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions
3. Variation of skin conditions, e.g., skin color, natural hairs or veins
